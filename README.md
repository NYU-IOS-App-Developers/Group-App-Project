## Overview
### Description
Many young people with a low budget have limited knowledge of how to cook for themselves. They either cook similar meals every day or get grab-and-go meals, which are considered unhealthy. Our target audience is college students who want to learn how to cook for themselves.

We want to develop a mobile app that will provide its users with functionalities to learn how to cook and track their progress. The app will give recipe recommendations based on user's present ingredients, dietary restrictions, time commitment and other personal preferences. 



// We want to build a community of people who encourage each other to cook new meals and eat healthily. 




### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Music
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes users music choices, and connects them to other users with similar choices. The user can then decide to message this person and befriend them if wanted.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** First we would start with pairing people based on music taste, then perhaps this could evolve into a music sharing application as well to broaden its usage. Large potential for use with spotify, apple music, or other music streaming applications.
